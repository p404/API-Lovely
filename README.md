# API-Lovely
 
This Quickstart guide will show you how to use Compose to run a Python3.4/PostgreSQL API. Before starting, youâ€™ll need to have Compose installed (see more details below).

 
## Development enviroment 
### Requirements

You must have both [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) (or a
[Docker Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/) host) and
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) running on your machine.

You can find instructions for the recommended setup on
[Linux](https://docs.docker.com), [Mac OSX](https://docs.docker.com) and
[Windows 8+](https://docs.docker.com).


### Run containers

The next step to run our containers is build them. for this
you need to run:

	docker-compose build

To spin up our containers:

	docker-compose up

Stopping the containers:

	docker-compose stop

### Usage

Check the running app web interface with the IP you receive from you Docker machine with port 8000

Example:
	
	http://192.168.99.100:8000


##### Creating an user in the API
For using the API, you need a valid user and password in the database.

	docker-compose run api python3 manage.py createsuperuser
	
If you need a shell, run:

	docker-compose run api python3 manage.py shell
	
##### Testing the API
After you created and user and password, now you can test the API with this new credentials.

	curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json; indent=4' -u USERNAME_HERE:PASSWORD_HERE -X POST -d '{"beds": 2, "baths": 1, "address": "123 Some St, Gotham, IL 51944", "provider_name": "RentingIsTheBestAround", "price": 750}' http://192.168.99.100:8000/listings/

## Production environment 
Assuming that you have configurated the salt-master instance and you have an public key uploaded. you can run the deploy.py script

Installing deps :

	pip install paramiko -v 1.16.0
 
Creating new AWS Instances:
	
	python deploy.py cold -n production-environment

Deploying a new version of the container in all servers:

	python deploy up
